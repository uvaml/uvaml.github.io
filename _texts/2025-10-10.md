**Overview**
Continuing the success from the first AI/ML resource last year (see [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbfBSV6pTXbvdU619) and [previous posters](https://uvaml.github.io/pasttalks/2024-10-03/)), we will have our second UVA AI/ML resource fair at Link Lab again this year! 

The goal of the resource fair is to encourage collaboration between labs and graduate students, and for motivating undergrads to look for research opportunities. This resource fair includes posters from various labs across departments in SEAS.
