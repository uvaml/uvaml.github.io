**Abstract**
Video understanding remains one of the most challenging frontiers in computer vision, with critical applications in autonomous vehicles, security systems, industrial automation, and educational technology. While Transformer networks have revolutionized artificial intelligence - most notably in language models like ChatGPT - their application to video analysis has not yet reached its full potential. This talk introduces innovative architectural enhancements to Transformer networks specifically optimized for video understanding. Unlike traditional Transformers, which were originally designed for natural language processing and later adapted for static images, our approach addresses the unique challenges of temporal information and motion dynamics in video data. Through several novel methods, we demonstrate how these enhanced architectures can better capture the complex relationships between spatial and temporal features in video sequences, potentially opening new possibilities for more sophisticated video analysis systems.
