**Abstract**
Large-scale model hubs (e.g., Hugging Face, Kaggle) and numerous private repositories collectively host millions of pretrained and fine-tuned models, primarily large language models (LLMs). As the de facto infrastructure for AI model development and sharing, these platforms support a vast ecosystem of downstream applications across research and industry. However, their storage footprint has grown explosively---Hugging Face alone hosted over 70 PB of model artifacts in late 2025 and continues to expand exponentially, posing mounting sustainability challenges. 

In this talk, I will present a new perspective on sustainable, large-scale modern AI model storage that rethinks system design from the ground up. I will first show how fine-tuned models within a model family exhibit high latent redundancy, enabling storage systems to move beyond generic compression toward model-aware data reduction. I will then talk about why model-level assumptions fundamentally break down and why storage systems must be redesigned around a tensor-centric abstraction that minimizes redundancy at the tensor level. Finally, I will share a vision for a tensor-centric AI ecosystem built around the tensor-centric storage infrastructure.
