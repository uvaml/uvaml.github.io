**Abstract**

**Bio:**
Yue Cheng holds a dual appointment as an Assistant Professor in the School of Data Science and in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to joining UVA in 2022, he was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at George Mason University. Cheng's research interests include distributed systems, cloud and serverless computing, high-performance computing, and operating systems. His research is driven by the complexities of modern data-intensive computer systems, and the need for more efficient and easy-to-use approaches to manage such complexities. His current research focuses on designing efficient data systems for data science: (1) designing efficient stateful serverless computing systems using a full-stack approach spanning applications, platforms, and OS/hardware; and (2) building better computing and storage systems for distributed machine learning.
