**Abstract**


**Bio:**
Zhe Zeng is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to that, she was a Faculty Fellow in the Computer Science Department at New York University, working with Andrew Gordon Wilson. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2024 under the supervision of Guy Van den Broeck. She received the Amazon Doctoral Student Fellowship in 2022 and the NEC Student Research Fellowship in 2021, and was selected for the Rising Stars in EECS in 2023.

Her research interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on neurosymbolic AI and probabilistic ML. Her research aims to enable and support decision-making in the real world in the presence of probabilistic uncertainty and symbolic knowledge (graph structures, logical, arithmetic, and physical constraints, etc.) to achieve trustworthy AI and aid scientific discoveries.
