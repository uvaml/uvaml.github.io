**Abstract**


**Bio:**
Greg is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at George Mason University, where he runs the Robotic Anticipatory Intelligence & Learning (RAIL) Group and is the director of the GMU Autonomous Robotics Lab. His research, at the intersection of robotics, planning, and machine learning, is centered around developing representations for planning and learning that allow robots to better understand the impact of their actions, so that they may plan quickly, intelligently, and reliably in a dynamic and uncertain world. Before joining Mason, he received his PhD in 2020 from the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and previously graduated summa cum laude from Cornell University with a B.S. in Applied and Engineering Physics. His work was a finalist for Best Paper at the 2018 Conference on Robot Learning, at which he was additionally awarded Best Oral Presentation.
