**Abstract**


**Bio:**
Jiaming is an assistant professor in Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My research aims to bridge AI with clinical decisions and focuses on machine learning, large language models, data mining, graph neural networks, scientific modeling, and public health. I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2024 (advisor: Prof. B. Aditya Prakash). I was also a postdoctoral research associate in the Biocomplexity Institute at University of Virginia (supervisors: Prof. Anil Vullikanti and Prof. Gregory Madden). Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, where I received my Bachelor's degrees in both Information Engineering and Finance and graduated with honors.
